/* 
Event Propagation : Event propagation is a mechanism that defines how events travel through the DOM tree when an event is triggered on an element. 
                By default, event handlers are attached to the bubbling phase. 
                
Event Bubbling Phase : After the event reaches the target element, it "bubbles up" through the parent elements towards the top. 
                First the target element (child) is executed and then its parent element is executed. 
                
Event Capturing Phase: The event starts at the outermost element (window or document) and "trickles down" towards the target element. 
                Event handlers registered for the capturing phase will be executed first, before the target element.

/*


1. **Type**: This refers to the type of event that has occurred, such as 'click', 'mouseover', 'keydown', etc. It specifies the nature of the interaction that triggered the event.

2. **Timestamp**: The timestamp indicates the time at which the event occurred. It provides information about when the event was triggered, allowing for time-based event handling.

3. **defaultPrevented**: This property indicates whether the default action of the event has been prevented by calling `event.preventDefault()`. It is a boolean value that can be used to check if the default behavior should be overridden.

4. **Target**: The target property of the event object refers to the element on which the event was originally triggered. It represents the specific DOM element that the event is associated with.

5. **toElement**: This property is specific to certain types of events (like mouse events) and represents the element the mouse pointer is moving to when leaving the current element.

6. **srcElement**: Similar to `toElement`, `srcElement` represents the element that triggered the event or the element that the event was dispatched to.

7. **currentTarget**: The `currentTarget` property refers to the element that the event listener is attached to. It can be useful when dealing with event delegation or capturing/bubbling phases.

8. **clientX, clientY**: These properties provide the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the browser window when the event occurred. They are often used in mouse-related events.

9. **screenX, screenY**: Similar to `clientX` and `clientY`, `screenX` and `screenY` provide the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the screen or monitor.

10. **altKey, ctrlKey, shiftKey**: These properties indicate whether the 'Alt', 'Ctrl', or 'Shift' key was pressed when the event occurred. They are boolean values that can be used to check for modifier key states.

11. **keyCode**: For keyboard events, the `keyCode` property represents the numerical value of the key that was pressed. It can be used to determine which key triggered the event.
